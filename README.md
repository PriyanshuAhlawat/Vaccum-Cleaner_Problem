# Vaccum-Cleaner_Problem
Vacuum cleaner problem is a well-known search problem for an agent which works on Artificial Intelligence.
In this problem, our vacuum cleaner is our agent. It is a goal based agent, and the goal of this agent, which is the vacuum cleaner, is to clean up the whole area. 
So, in the classical vacuum cleaner problem, we have two rooms and one vacuum cleaner. There is dirt in both the rooms and it is to be cleaned. The vacuum cleaner is present in any one of these rooms.
So, we have to reach a state in which both the rooms are clean and are dust free.
